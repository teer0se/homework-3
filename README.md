# Random Password Generator

## Assignment:

Tasked with creating a random password generator with certain criteria, I utilized JS, CSS, and HTML to create a working generator.

### Breakdown:

Linked style.css in header and script.js at bottom of body so it loads in last

Created a centered container with a text box where the generated password will appear and a slider with a minimum value of 8 and a max value of 128, per instructions

Created 3 checkboxes for including uppercase, lowercase, or symbols in the generated password

Created the "Generate Password" button

Added multiple const tags to define the outcome of the password

Created a function that utilizes a for loop to generate whenever the button is clicked and corresponds to the character limit set on the slider and takes into account which of the 3 checkboxes are ticked

Added multiple CSS stylings including margins, padding, background and container colors.
